# CNX Case Study

## Situation

TelCo Inc., a telecommunications company, has noticed that the company’s customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores are low and contact volume is high.
The client is concerned about how the poor experience is impacting their brand perception. The client thinks there are some opportunities to improve the end-to-end customer experience, but they are not sure what their customers pain points are. 
They have asked you to analyze their current state and identify if there is anything driving these issues and then present the story behind the numbers at an executive meeting. The following sections contain the information you will need to complete their request.
